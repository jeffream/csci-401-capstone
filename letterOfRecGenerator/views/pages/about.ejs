            <p> In academia and industry, writing letters of recommendation is a very
                important task. Many faculty and professionals have a standard template
                that is merely customized for each request. Others may ask the person to
                write the recommendation himself, then verify it is accurate before signing.
                Although this may work, it would be much better if the person requesting
                the recommendation could help structure the recommendation.
                This project will allow a person requesting a recommendation to submit all
                of the information he wants included through a form, and the person
                writing the recommendation can then automatically pull that information
                into a template that he has created. After the letter has been generated,
                the recommender can download it and ensure it is accurate. After the
                recommender approves it, the original person can also download the
                electronic version of the letter.
                Many additional features can be added to this project, and hopefully the
                group can help to come up with other features after the core functionality
                has been implemented.

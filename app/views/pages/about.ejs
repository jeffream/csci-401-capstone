              <p id="description"> In academia and industry, writing letters of recommendation is a very
                  important task. Many faculty and professionals have a standard template
                  that is merely customized for each request. Others may ask the person to
                  write the recommendation himself, then verify it is accurate before signing.
                  Although this may work, it would be much better if the person requesting
                  the recommendation could help structure the recommendation.
              <br><br>
                  This application allows a person requesting a recommendation to submit all
                  of the information he wants included through a form, and the person
                  writing the recommendation can then automatically pull that information
                  into a template that he has created. After the letter has been generated,
                  the recommender can download it and ensure it is accurate. After the
                  recommender approves it, the original person can also download the
                  electronic version of the letter.

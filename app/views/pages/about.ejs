              <p id="description"> In academia and industry, writing letters of recommendation is a very
                  important task. Many faculty and professionals have a standard template
                  that is merely customized for each request. Others may ask the person to
                  write the recommendation himself, then verify it is accurate before signing.
                  Although this may work, it would be much better if the person requesting
                  the recommendation could help structure the recommendation.
              <br><br>
                  This application allows a person requesting a recommendation to submit all
                  of the information he wants included through a form, and the person
                  writing the recommendation can then automatically pull that information
                  into a template that he has created. After the letter has been generated,
                  the recommender can download it and ensure it is accurate. After the
                  recommender approves it, the original person can also download the
                  electronic version of the letter.

                        templates can serve different purposes. For example, <br>
                        a letter for an internship position, full-time position,<br>
                         and scholarship award all may look different. <br>

                        First you will see a list of standardized questions that are likely <br>
                        to appear in every template you create (First name, last name, & personal pronouns). <br>
                        We encourage that you create additional questions based on the type of letter you are <br>
                        writing. If you wish to create an internship recommendation letter, then create a question <br>
                        asking which company the student is applying to. Once the proper questions are in place <br>
                        write the body of the letter in the text editor area. Be sure to include a "tag" wherever <br>
                        is appropriate (see example on right). Finally, the last step is to upload an input <br>
                        document if you wish for the letter to have your own custom header and footer. Just <br>
                        make sure that the input document is a .docx file and that {description} is typed in <br>
                        where you'd like the body of the letter to be. <br>

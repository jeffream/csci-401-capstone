              <p id="description"> In academia and industry, writing letters of recommendation is a very
                  important task. Many faculty and professionals have a standard template
                  that is merely customized for each request. Others may ask the person to
                  write the recommendation himself, then verify it is accurate before signing.
                  Although this may work, it would be much better if the person requesting
                  the recommendation could help structure the recommendation.
                  <br><br>
                  This application streamlines the process of writing these letters. The professor sends a
                  survey to the student requesting a recommendation letter, and the contents of that survey
                  will automatically populate into a custom letter template. After the letter has been generated,
                  the recommender still has the ability to add more details regarding that specific candidate, and
                  then the letter is ready to be distributed.

                  <p id="tutorial">
                    The first step is to create a template. Navigate to
                    the Templates page, and click the "Create Template"
                    button towards the right side of the page. Different
                    templates can serve different purposes. For example,
                    a letter for an internship position, full-time position,
                    and scholarship award all may look different.

                  <p id="tutorial">
                    First, you will see a list of standardized questions that are likely
                    to appear in every template you create (First name, last name, & personal pronouns).
                    We encourage that you create additional questions based on the type of letter you are
                    writing. If you wish to create an internship recommendation letter, then create a question
                    asking which position the student is applying for. Once the proper questions are in place,
                    write the body of the letter in the text editor area. Be sure to include a "tag" wherever
                    is appropriate (see example on right).
                    <br><br>
                    The last step is to upload an input document if you wish for the letter to have
                    your own custom header and footer. Just make sure that the input document is a .docx file
                    named "input.docx" and that {description} is typed in where you'd like the body of the
                    letter to be (see example input document below).

                  <p id="tutorial">
                    Now that you have a template, you may start fulfilling recommendation letter requests.
                    When a recommendee asks you for a letter, start the
                    process by clicking the "Create Recommendation" button. This will send a
                    survey to the recommendee via email, prompting them to fill out the appropriate
                    questions based on your selected template. Once the survey is complete you
                    will receive an email notification, however, you can always check the status of the survey
                    by refreshing the page and seeing whether the status icon is a red X or green
                    checkmark. A green checkmark signifies that the survey has been completed and
                    that the letter is ready to be downloaded and distributed.

                  <p id="tutorial">
                    Once the survey is complete, click the "View Responses" button on the recommender dashboard
                    to check for any typos in the student's responses. If there is a small typo, you may edit
                    the response yourself instead of having to resend the survey and wait for its completion.
                    If there are no typos, go back to the recommender dashboard and click the "Preview Letter"
                    button. Here you can review the letter, save it, and download it. The output file is a
                    .docx file and will be called "output.docx".
